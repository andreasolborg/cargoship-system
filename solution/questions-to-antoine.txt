What should be tested? And where?
    - No need for exception handling. Tests in main are ok.


Comparing loading a set of containers vs loading a ship
- 26 seconds to load 6k containers onto  23x22x18 ship
- ~~0 seconds when loading the ship from a alreay sorted file
- We should instead keep track of the empty space in the ship, and load the containers in the most optimal way.

Should a 40-feet be named twice? Wouldnt it be better to mark it somewhat different?



Cannot sort the list before you load it into the ship
- 2 and 2 are paired lists?
20 feet comes in pairs, so we need to hold them in a list
bin packing
hold list
multiply cargo of 20 feet to sort
always load onto the lightest section


insert and remove can be done in O(1) time, but if used we need to reflect on it

We can make assumptions that a ship would not leave the port unless the ship is full
